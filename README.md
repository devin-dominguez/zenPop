#zenPop
zenPop is an in-progress experiment in using a video game as an OSC controller.

zenPop uses [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc) as well as some addons.

This is still in the early stage and is still missing most of the OSC functionality.

##Use
Generate an oF project with the ofxOSC addon and copy the contents of the zenPop src folder to your new project folder.
